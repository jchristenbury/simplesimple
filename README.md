SimpleSimple is my first effort at building my own WordPress theme from scratch. 

It is intended to - currently - be stripped down. I will add more features as I go. The current focus is to write everything from scratch, from the ground up, to make a complete starter theme for my own use. Some of things I will be focusing on are nice typography out of the box, the ability to customize the theme from the options panel using the baked in WordPress functions. These are all things I have done before on multiple projects but I wanted to combine all of my knowledge into one project.
